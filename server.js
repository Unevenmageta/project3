Tasks we still need to finish:

We need to have 3 new components: 
1) list component that displays a list of trips and 
2) trip component that displays the data of a given trip 
3) On the "trips" page, we need a button component to save a trip
Thoughts behind it: once a user is signed in, we need to give them access to 
a list of trips that they have saved. And when the user clicks on a trip 
they're interested in, it should give them a list of data fot that trip.
what data should that consist of? Hotels nearby, step by step directions 
places of interest, restaurants?
